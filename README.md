Low Latency C++ Trading Examples
A collection of simple → intermediate → advanced C++ code snippets that I created while learning HFT concepts, low-latency programming, system design, and trading logic.
This repo includes my practice on:

 *Lambdas & Functional Interfaces

 *Multithreading & High-performance patterns

 *Memory management (stack vs heap, cache-line optimizations)

 *Functors, callbacks & event-driven architectures

 *Trading logic simulations (order execution, spreads, callbacks)

 (Practical examples used in quant/HFT interviews

The goal of this repo is simple:
Build strong fundamentals for quant developer + HFT engineering roles using clean, small, and interview-friendly C++ examples.
